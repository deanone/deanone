## ðŸš€ About Me
I am an engineer and I love software. Throughout my career, I have held many positions in the software development industry, starting as a clueless freshman software engineer back in 2013.
\
\
Currently, I work as a senior software engineering manager at Oracle.
\
\
My motto is simple: build software that makes people's lives better.
\
\
In the past, I have conducted research in the intersection of three scientific fields: big data analytics, time series forecasting and high performance computing. I strongly believe that science is the only thing that can save us humans from ourselves.
