## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a senior software engineer working as a software development team lead at the [Pfizer Center for Digital Innovation (CDI)](https://centerfordigitalinnovation.pfizer.com/) in Thessaloniki, Greece. I have been working in the software development industry for almost 10 years now. What always excites me is to write clean code that works and makes people lives a little better. 
\
\
In the past, I have conducted research in the intersection of three scientific fields: big data analytics, time series forecasting and high performance computing.
\
\
Finally, I am very much interested in the open source software development process. I joined the open source community as a committer and project lead of the [Eclipse OpenSmartCLIDE](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ecd.opensmartclide) project in October 2022.
